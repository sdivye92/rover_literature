<h4>A Novel Deep Neural Network Architecture for Mars Visual Navigation</h6>

*Jiang Zhang, Yuanqing Xia, Ganghui Shen*

- There are two main methods for Mars visual navigation:
  - Blind: Navigation commands are pre-fed to rover by an engineer from the ground station.
  - AutoNav: Operates automously with human interference.

- AutoNav used algorithms like Dijkstra, A* or D* for finding path on a grid map.
- These are computationally heavy and memory comsuming algorithms which can easily explod as map size increases.
- Introduction of smarter and intellegent algorithms like neural networks, genetic algorithm, and swarm algorithms to solve Mars navigation problems efficiently.
- However pre-defined location of obstacles is required for these algorithms as well.
